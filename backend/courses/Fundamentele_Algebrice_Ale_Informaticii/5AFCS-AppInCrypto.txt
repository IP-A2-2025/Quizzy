Introduction to cryptography
o Cryptography is the field concerned with techniques for securing
information, particularly in communications;
0 Cryptography focuses on the following main paradigms:

0 Privacy/conﬁdentiality — ensuring that no one can read the message
except the intended receiver;

o Authentication — the process of proving one's identity (the primary
forms of host-to-host authentication on the Internet today are
name-based or address-based, both of which are notoriously weak);

o Integrity — assuring the receiver that the received message has not
been altered in any way from the original.

Applications of cryptography
o Computer and information security: cryptography is necessary when
communicating over any untrusted medium, which includes just
about any network, particularly the Internet.
0 e-commerce, e-payment, e-voting, e-auction, e-Iottery, and
e-gambling schemes, are all based on cryptographic (security)
protocols.
Examples of software tools that havily rely on cryptographic techniques:
lPsec, SSL&TLS, DNSsec, S/IVIIIVIE, SET etc.

The RSA cipher
The RSA cipher, proposed in 1977 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and
Leonard Adleman is one of the most prominent public-key ciphers that is
still secure and in use.
Key generation: public key: (n, e), where
n : pq, p and q distinct primes
*
e E Z44”)
private key: (p, q, d), where
ed E 1 mod ¢(n)
Encryption of x e Zn: output c : Xe mod n mod n
Decryption of c e Zn: output X : cd mod n
Correctness: (Xe)d E X mod n, for all X G Zn Prove it!

The RSA cipher
Example 1 (With artificially small parameters)
Let p : 61 and q : 53. Then:
o n : pq : 3233 and ¢(n) : 3120;
0 If we chose e I 17, then d can be computed with the extended
Euclidean algorithm. We obtain d : e_1 mod 3120 : 2753;
0 n I 3233 and e I 17 are public parameters; p, q, and d private;
Let x I 123 be a plaintext. The cryptotext is
c I 12317 mod 3233 I 855.
In order to decrypt y we compute
8552753 mod 3233 z 123.

Security of the RSA cipher
Security issues:
0 If p or q is recovered (e.g., by factoring n in reasonable time), then
the system is completely broken;
o If gb(n) can be computed in reasonable time, then the system is
completely broken;
o If d can be easily computed from n and e, then the system is
completely broken.
In practice:
0 p and q are 512-bit primes (or even larger);
o e is small (fast encryption) but chosen such that d > W (otherwise,
an efficient attack can be mounted).

Digital signatures
Public key cryptography solves another problem crucial to e-commerce
and Internet cyber relationship: it lets you emulate written signatures.
This use of the public-key is called digital signature.
A digital signature must provide:

o authenticity and integrity. That is, it must be "impossible" for
anyone who does not have access to the secret key to forge (x, s) (x
is the original data and s is its associated signature);

0 non-repudiation. That is, it must be impossible for the legitimate
signer to repudiate his own signature.

Signing (encrypting with a private key) is extremely slow, so you usually
add a time-saving (and space-saving) step before you encrypt messages.
It is called message digesting or hashing.

Digital signatures from public-key ciphers
Public-key ciphers may be used to produce digital signatures:
o Assume that Ke is A's public key and Kd is A's private key and,
moreover, eKe(de(x)) : x;
o Then, the decryption of a message x by Kd is the digital signature
associated to x. It can be verified by Ke:
7
X I eKJC/KAXD-
Therefore, in such a case, Kd is used to sign messages (it will be
secret) and Ke is used to verify signatures (it will be public).
The RSA signature is obtained from the RSA public-key cipher.

The RSA digital signature
Example 2 (With artificially small parameters)
Let p I 61 and q I 53. Then:
0 n I pq I 3233 and $(n) I 3120;
o If we chose e I 17, then d can be computed with the extended
Euclidean algorithm. We obtain d I e’1 mod 3120 I 2753;
o n I 3233 and e I 17 are public parameters to verify signatures; p,
q, and d are private parameters to sign messages;
Let x I 123 be a message. The signature is
s Z 1232753 mod 3233 I 2746.
So, (123,2746) is the signed message.
In order to verify the signature for (1237 2746) we compute
274617 mod 3233 z 123.

Threshold sharing schemes
The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) has numerous applications in
various fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering. We
illustrate below an application of it to secret sharing.
A (k, n)-thresho|d sharing scheme, where k g n, consists of n parties
P1, . . . , Pn sharing a secret S such that the following properties hold:
1. each P,- has an information l,- (secret share);
2. knowledge of any k of [1,. . . , In enables one to find 5 easily;
3. knowledge of less than k of I17 . . . , /n does not enable one to find S
easily.
o Party P,- : people, software/hardware computing device Simply
denote it by i and refer to it as user or participant;
o Secrets and secret shares are usually viewed as integers.

sequence of pairwise coprime integers m0 < m1 < < mn. All are
public parameters;
2. Secret and share spaces: the secret space is Zmo and the share
space of the ith participant is Zmi, for all 1 g i g n;
3. Secret sharing: given s G Zmo, share it by s,- : s’ mod mi, for all

where r0 : s and r,- is randomly chosen from Zm, for all 1 g i g t;

1. Parameter setup: t I 2, n I 5 and

r2 : 5, and solve the system
X E31 137 X E37 3, X E41 5
We get s’ : 37151 and then the shares 3, 5, 42, 21, 51
3. Secret reconstruction: Assume that the last 3 participants want to
recover the secret s. They solve the system
X E43 42, X E47 21, X E53 51
and get 37151. By reducing this modulo 31 they obtain s : 13.

share space HIE! Zmi;

rate of each participant goes to 1 as m0 —> oo.

Security of the GRS scheme
A sequence m0, m1, . . . , m,, of pairwise co-prime integers is called
compact if m1 < < mn and there exists (9 G (0,1) such that
0 0

Theorem 4
The GRS secret sharing scheme is asymptotically ideal if and only if it is
based on compact sequences of co-primes.

Security issues:
o lf a root of a can be efficiently computed, then the system is

o lf p or q is recovered (e.g., by factoring n in reasonable time), then
the system is completely broken;
o c E t + at_1 mod n is equivalent to t2 — ct + a E O mod n, for
t 6 Zj. When a is a quadratic residue modulo n and c is a
ciphertext, the congruence may have one, two, 0r four roots, and all
have the same Jacoby symbol. Therefore, if one root can be
efficiently computed, the message can be recovered.
