Rings

Definition 1
A ring is an algebraic structure (R,—i-7 —,O7 ) such that:

o (R,+, —,O) is a commutative group;

0 (R7 ) is a semigroup;

0 - is left- and right-distributive over +.
Remark 2
Let (R, +, —, O, -) be a ring.

1. “+" and ”-" are usually cal/ed addition and multiplication;

2. 0 is cal/ed the zero element of R. lt is unique;

3. lf- is commutative then the ring is called commutative;

4. We Will usually denote rings just by their carrier sets. That is, we

will often say “Let R be a ring".

fol/owing formula holds

Binomial formula

Remark 6

Let R be a commutative ring.

1. R does not need unity for the binomial formula to hold in R.

2. To apply the binomial formula for a and b, only ab : ba is needed
and not the commutativity of the who/e ring.

3. Conventions “a”bO is taken a” and “aob” is taken b” are not
required When the ring has unity.

Rings with unity
Definition 7
A ring with unity/identity is an algebraic structure (R,—l-7 —,O7 ~, e)
which satisfies:
o (R,+, <0) is a commutative group;
o (R, -,e) is a monoid;
o - is left- and right-distributive over +.
The element e, also denoted by 1R or 1, is called the unity/identity of R.
lt is unique.

Rings with unity
Prove the following result!
Proposition 8
[1‘(R7 +, —, O, -, e) is a ring with unity then e I O iffR I {O}.
Definition 9
A ring with unity (R,+, <0, -, e) which satisfies e : O is called a
trivial/null ring.
If R is a ring with unity, then the set
U(R):{a€ Rl3b€ R: ab:ba:e}
forms a group under multiplication (prove itl), called the group of units
or the unit group of R. Its elements are called units of R.

1.1 (R,+, —,O) is a commutative group;
1.2 (R,~,e) is a monoid and e 75 0;
1.3 ’ is a unary operation which satisfies aa’ I a’a I e, for any a ¢ O;
1.4 ' is left- and right-distributive over +.

Cancellation law of multiplication
The cancellation law of multiplication holds in a ring R if
ac:bcorcazcbimpliesa:borc:0,
for any a, b, c G R.
Proposition 12
Cancellation law of multiplication holds in any division ring.
There are important rings that are not division rings, but the cancellation
law still holds. Two such examples are the rings of integers and
polynomials.

Zero divisors and the cancellation law
Definition 13
An element a E R — {O} of a ring R is called a zero divisor if there
exists b G R — {O} such that ab : O or ba : O.
Example 14

the law of cancellation.
2. Division rings do not have zero divisors.

Rings
Example 18
1. Let (R,+, —,0) be a commutative group. Deﬁne on R the binary
operation - by a- b I O, for any a, b € R. Then, (R, +, —,O, ) is a
ring.
2. Z, together with addition and multiplication, form an integral
domain, but not a field.
3. Q, 1R, and (C, together with addition and multiplication, form fields.
4. nZ is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. This ring has unity
only if n I —1, n I O, or n I 1 (for n I O, the ring is null).
5. Zn is a commutative ring with unity. lf n is a prime, then Zn is a
field.

Homomorphisms
Definition 19
Let R1 and R2 be rings. A function h : R1 —> R2 is a ring
homomorphism if, for any a, b € R1, the following hold:
1. h(a + b) I h(a) + h(b);
2. h(ab) I h(a)h(b).
The second property in the definition above may only be required for
a7 b G R1 i {O}. Indeed, if, for instance, b I 0, then
h(aO) I h(O) I O I h(a)O I h(a)h(0).
If R1 and R2 have units e1 and e2, then the property
3. h(el) I 62
is required too.

Subﬁngs
Definition 20
Let R be a ring. A subring of R is a ring S such that S Q R and the
operations of S are exactly the operations of R restricted to S.
Alternatively, S Q R nonempty defines a subring of R if:
1. a—b€5, forany a,b€5;
2. ab E S, for any a,b 6 5.
If R has unity e, then e must be in 5 too, and if R is a division ring, the
second item should be replaced by “abi1 E S, for any a, b G 5 — {0}".
Example 21
nZ is a subring of Z, for any integer n (prove itl). The subset of odd
integers do not form a subring of Z (prove itl).

Ideals
Definition 22
Let R be a ring and J Q R.
1. R is called a left ideal in R if R is a subgroup of the additive group
of R and RJ Q J.
2. R is called a right ideal in R if R is a subgroup of the additive group
of R and JR Q J.
3. R is called an ideal in R if R is both a left and right ideal in R.
4. J is a proper ideal in R if it is an ideal in R and J yé {O} and J 5£ R.
Prove the following result!
Proposition 23
A commutative ring with unity is a fie/d if and only if it does not have
proper ideals.

Characteristic of a ring
Definition 24
1. We say that a ring R has characteristic n Z 1, if n is the smallest
natural number such that na I O, for any a € R.
2. We say that a ring R has characteristic zero if does not exist n Z 1
with na : 0er any a G R.
The characteristic of a ring R will be denoted by char(R).
Remark 25
A ring with unity e 51$ 0 cannot have the characteristic 1. Therefore, the
only ring of characteristic 1 is the null ring.
Remark 26
If the characteristic ofa ring R is n > 1, then the additive order of each
non-zero element a G R divides n.

Characteristic of a ring: examples
Example 27
Z6 : {0, 1,2, 3,4, 5} has characteristic 6, which is the lcm of the orders
of its non-zero elements:
0 1 has additive order 6;
o 2 has additive order 3;
0 3 has additive order 2;
0 4 has additive order 3;
0 5 has additive order 6.
Example 28
(1) Zm has characteristic m, for any m Z 1.
(2) Z is an integral domain of characteristic zero.
(3) Q, 1R, and (C are fields of characteristic zero.

Characteristic of a ring: basic properties
Theorem 29
Let (R, +, —, O, -, e) be a ring with unity of characteristic n Z 1. Then:
1. n is the smallest non-zero natural number which satisfies ne : 0;
2. lfe 71$ 0 and R does not have zero divisors, then n is a prime.
Moreover, all non-zero elements have the same additive order n.
Proof.
See textbook [1], page 328. Just a few words on the second part of the
second item. The additive order of a non-zero element of R cannot be
1 and divides n. As n is a prime, it must be n. U
The first item above says that the characteristic n is the additive order of
the unity!

Corollary 30
The characteristic of an integral domain is zero or a prime number.
Proof.
From Theorem 29. U
Corollary 31
The characteristic of a finite fie/d is a prime number.
Proof.

Once more, when the characteristic is a prime p, all non-zero elements
have the additive order p!

Theorem 32
If a fie/d has characteristic a prime p, then it contains a subfie/d

Prime fields
A prime field is a field that does not possesses proper subfields (except
for the trivial field).
Theorem 34
A fie/d is prime if and only if it is isomorphic to Zp, for some prime p,
or Q.
Proof.
See textbook [1], page 329. U
Show that no field can contain two distinct prime subfields!
Combining with the previous results we obtain that every field contains a
prime subfield: if the field has characteristic a prime p, then the prime
subfield is isomorphic to Zp; if the subfield has characteristic O, its prime
subfield is isomorphic to Q.
