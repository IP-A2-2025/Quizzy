Binary symmetric channels
We will use only bloc binary codes.
Transmission channels can be classified into:
o noiseless channels (also called perfect channels);
o noise channels, which can be
o symmetric — the probability that a bit is (correctly) received is the
same for both bits;
0 asymmetric — it is not symmetric.
We will use only binary symmetric channels (BSC). Basic assumptions
about them:
o BSCs do not change the length of the binary sequence transmitted
through them;
o receiving order of the bits : sending order of the bits.

Reliability of a BSC
The reliability of a BSC is a real number p € (O, 1) which gives the
probability that the bit b received is the bit b sent.

We may consider only BSCs with reliability 1/2 < p < 1.

Information rate
Let C1 I {00,01,10,11}. With such a code, no error can be detected
(but they may occur).
Let C2 : {000,011,101,110} (obtained from C2 by adding the parity
bit). With such a code, any singular error is detected.
Definition 1
The information ratio of a code C of length n is
- log2|C|
C I i.
/r( ) n
Example 2
ir(C1) I 1 and ir(C2) I 2/3.

Minimum distance decoding — Maximum likelihood decoding
Let C be a code of length n. Assume that W € {O,1}” was received.
How do we decode w?
Minimum distance decoding (MDD): choose v € C to minimize d, the
number of positions on which v and w disagree.
Maximum likelihood decoding (MLD): choose v G C t0 maximize the
probability that v was sent when w was received. This probability is
¢P(V1W) : pn—d(1 — p)dv
where p is the channel reliability and d is as above.
Example 4
Let C be a code of length 5 and p the channel reliability. If 10101 G C,
then
¢p(10101, 01101) I p3(1 _ p)2.

Theorem 5
Let C be a code of length n, v1, v2 € C, and W € {O,1}”, and d1 (d2)
be the number of positions on which v1 and w (v2 and w, respective/y),
disagree. Then,
¢p(v1,w) g ¢p(v2, W) <=> d1 Z d2
(it is assumed that the channel reliability satisﬁes 1/2 < p < 1).

Hamming weight and distance
We will work exclusively with the vector space F2”, where F2 : Z2.
Vector addition and scalar multiplication are given by:
' X1"‘Xn+y1"'yn: (X1+y1)~-(Xn+yn);
Where a,x,-,y,- € F2, x,- +y,- is the addition modulo 2, and (,Y-X,‘ is given by
O-O:O-1:1-0:Oand 1-1:1.
Definition 6
Let v E {0,1}*. The Hamming weigth of v, denoted HW(v), is the
number of ls in v.
Definition 7
Let v, W 6 {0,1}", for some n. The Hamming distance of v and W,
denoted Hd(v, W), is Hd(v, W) I HW(v + w).

Code distance and transmission error
Definition 9
Let C be a code. The distance of C, denoted d(C), is
d(C) I min{Hd(v, W)|v7 W 6 C, v 75 W}.
Example 10
1. For the code C : {00110011,01101101,01010110}, d(C) : 4
2. For the code C I {00110011,01101101,01010110,01010011},
d(C) : 2
A transmission error for a code C of length n is any non-zero vector e of
length n (that is, e E {O,1}" 2 {O”}).

Error detecting codes
Definition 11
Let C be a code of length n.
l. C detects the error e € {O,1}” i {0”} if v + e ¢ C, for any v Q C.
2. C is a t-detector code if C detects any error with Hamming weight
at most t, but there exists an error with Hamming weight t + 1 that
cannot be detected by C.
Theorem 12
Let C be a code of length n and distance d. Then,
1. C detects all errors e € {0,1}” — {0”} With Hw(e) § d — 1;
2. There exists at least one error e e {O,1}” — {0”} with Hw(e) : d
that cannot be detected by C.

Linear codes
Definition 15
Let IFq be a ﬁnite field with q elements. A linear code of length n Z 1
and rank k over IFq, Where 1 g k g n, also called an [n7 k]-code over
qu, is a subspace of dimension k of the vector space lFZ.
If C is an [n7 kl-code of distance d over qu, we will also say that C is an
[n7 k7 d]-code over Fq.
Any [n, kl-code can be specified by a basis B of cardinality k. This basis
can be arranged into a matrix G G Mk,n(Fq) whose rows are B's vectors.
G is called a generating matrix of C.

Dual code and parity check matrix

Definition 16

Let C be an [n7 k]-code over qu. The dual code of C, denoted Cl, is

the set of all vectors that are orthogonal on C.

Clearly, Cl is an [n, n i k]-code over Fq.

A generator matrix for the dual code is called a parity-check matrix for

the original code and vice versa. If H is such a matrix, then

C I {v 6 Fngvt I O}

Proposition 17

If G I (lk A) is a generating matrix of an [n, k]-code, then

H I (—At Inik) is a parity check matrix of the code.

Proof.

Syndrome decoding
Given y € F2, Hyt is called the syndrome of y. Therefore, C is the set of
all vectors whose syndrome is 0.
Any code of length n induces an equivalence relation on ng:
u ~C v <:> v i u € C
Clearly, all elements in the same equivalence class have the same
syndrome.
Syndrome decoding works as follows:
1. Compute the syndrome of y, s I Hyt;
2. Find the equivalence class where y belongs to and take the
minimum-weight vector e in it. e is interpreted as the error;
3. Return v I y — e.

Syndrome decoding
Let C be the code given by the generating matrix
1 1 1 O 0
G I 0 O 1 1 O
1 1 1 1 1
A parity check matrix for C is
H I 1 1 O O 0
1 O 1 1 1
Assume that x I (1,1,0) is encoded and the error e I (O, 1, O, 1,0)
occurred during transmission. Therefore, the received vector is
XG + e I (1,1,0,1,0) + (0,1,0,1,0) I (1,0,0,0,0) Iy.
The syndrome of y is Hyt I (1,1) I s. One can check that the
minimum-weight vector in the equivalence class corresponding to s is e.
So, we decode y by y — e I x.
