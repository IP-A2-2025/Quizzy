Closures — example
Example 1
Let A be a set of atomic propositions. The set PF(A) of propositional
formulas over A is the least set which fulfills the following properties:
o A Q PF(A);
o If a and 5 are propositional formulas over A, then
pa, (a \/ ﬂ), (a /\ 5), (a :> ﬁ), and (a (I) ﬂ)
are propositional formulas over A.
The three key features of PF(A):
1. “includes A";
2. “closed under" p, \/, A, :>, <i>;
3. “least set” with the above properties.

Constructors and closures
An n-ary constructor over a set V is a relation r from V” to V. That is,
the elements of r are of the form ((a1,. . . ,an),a).
Given an n-ary constructor r and a set A, denote by r(A) the set:
r(A) : {al(Ela1, . . . , an G A)(((a1, . . . , an), a) G r)}
Definition 2
Let A be a set and R be a set of constructors. The closure of A under
R is the least set B Q V with the properties:
o A Q B;
0 B is closed under R, i.e., r(B) Q B, for any r E R.

Existence of Closures
Theorem 3 (Existence of closures)
Given a set A and a set R of constructors, the closure of A under R
exists and it is unique. Moreover, if R[A] denotes the closure of A
under R, then
R[A] I U Bm ,
mZO

where

O BO I A"

0 Bm+1 I Bm U UreR r(Bm), for any m Z O.

The set of natural numbers as a closure
Definition 4
The successor of a set x, denoted 5(x), is the set 5(x) I x U {x}.
Recall that the natural numbers are defined as follows:
0 O I (l);
° 1 I 5(0) I {0} I {9)};
- 2 : 5(1) : {0,1} : {Mm} etc-
Therefore, N is the closure of {O} under R I {5}.

Structural induction
Theorem 11 (Structural induction)
Let B I RM] and P be a property such that:
o P(a), for any a € A;
o (P(a1) /\ - - - /\ P(a,,) :> P(a)), for any r G R and a1, . . .,a,,,a € B
with ((al....,a,1),a) 6 r.
Then, P is satisfied by any a € B.
Proof.
See textbook [2] pages 86-87. U
Remark 12
1. Structural induction is equivalent to mathematical induction.
2. Structural induction is more appropriate for proving properties of
closures than mathematical induction.

Structural induction — example
Example 13
Let A be a set of atomic propositions. The set PF(A) of propositional
formulas as defined in Example 1 is the closure of A under some set of
constructors (prove it!).
Let P(a) be the following property:
P(a) : a has as many left brackets as right brackets.
By structural induction we can easily prove that P is satisfied by all
propositional formulas over A (prove it!).

If the chain

Definitions by recursion
Assume that B is inductively defined by A and R. lt would be a good
idea to define functions f on B in a recursive way as follows:
0 Define f for any a 6 A;
o If ((al, . . . , an)7 a) 6 r and the function has already been defined for
21, . . . , an, then define the function for a as a combination of the
values f(a1),. . . , f(a,,) in the form
h(r)(f(a1)7 . . . , f(a,,))7
Where h associates a (partial) function h(r) to r.

***************page number:20**************
Definitions by recursion
The definition above has a main drawback: it could not work for some
sets B Just think that the element a above might be defined in at least
two different ways,
((31,...,a,,),a) G r
and
((a1,...,afn),a) G r’.
In such a case, you must be assured that
h(r)(f(a1)7 . . . , f(a,,)) I h(r’)(f(a’1),...,f(afn)).
The easiest way to have this property fulﬁlled is to ask for each element
a € B to have exactly one inductive construction from A and R. If B has
this property then it is called a free inductively defined set.

Definitions by recursion
Lemma 15
Let B : R[A], C a set, g : A —> C, and h a function which associates a
partial function h(r) : Cn —> C to each r G R, where n is the arity of r.
Then, there exists a unique relation f Q B >< C such that:
1. (a,g(a)) G f, for any a G A;
2. lf(a1,b1),...,(a,,,b,,) G f, ((a1,...,a,,),a) G r and
h(r)(b17 . . . , bnﬂ, then (a, h(r)(b1, . . . , bn)) G f;
3. f is the least relation from B to C which satisfies (1) and (2).
Proof.

Definitions by recursion
Definition 16
A set B is called free inductively defined by A and R if, for any a G B,
o Either a E A, or
0 There exists a unique r € R and a unique n-tuple (21,...,a,1) such
that ((511,. . . ,an),a) G r, where n is the arity of r (for n : O we
understand that a 6 r).
Now, we can obtain the following important result.
Theorem 17 (Recursion theorem)
Let B, C, g, and h as in Lemma 15. IfB is free inductive/y defined by
A and R, then the binary relation f from Lemma 15 is a function.
Proof.

A slight extension of the recursion theorem is the following:

Let B I R[A], C a set, g : A —> C, and h a function which associates a
partial function h(r) : B” >< C" —> C to each r G R, where n is the arity
of r. lfB is free inductive/y defined by A and R, then there exists a
unique function f : B ~> C such that:
o f(a) : g(a), for any a G A;
o f(a) : h(r)(a1,.. .,a,,,f(a1),... , f(an)), for any a7 a17 . . . , an with
((a1,...,an),a) G r and h(r)(al,...,a,,,f(a1),...7 f(an,))l, where n

directly to:
