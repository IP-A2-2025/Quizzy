Linear map
Definition 1
Let U and V be vector spaces over a field F. A linear map from U to
V is a mapping f: U —> V such that
ﬂax + ﬂy) : af(x) -l— Bf(y),
for all mﬂ E F and X,y€ U.
Some authors use the term linear transformation or homomorphism,
which means the same as linear map!
Example 2
Let U and V be vector spaces over a field F.
1. Zero linear map: O: U —> V given by 0(u) : 0,er all u G U.
2. Identity linear map: l: U a U given by [(u) I u, for all u G U.
3. f : R3 —> R2 given by f(x,y,z) : (2x — 4y —l— 32,6x), for any
(x,y,z) E R3, is a linear map.

lsomorphism of vector spaces
Definition 3
Two vector spaces U and V over a field F are called isomorphic,
denoted U 2 V, if there exists a bijective linear map from U to V.
Proposition 4
If U and V are two vector spaces of the same (ﬁnite) dimension over a
fie/d F, then U and V are isomorphic.
Proof.
Let n I dim(U) : dim( V). Consider f: F” —> U given by
n
f(a1, . . . ,an) I Zan,
i:1
where {x1, . . . ,xn} is a basis of U.
f is a bijective linear map. Therefore, F” is isomorphic to U. ln a
similar way, F” is isomorphic to V. U

The vector space of linear maps
Given two vector spaces U and V over a field F, denote by HomF(U7 V)
or £F(U, V) the set of all linear maps from U to V.
Deﬁne the addition of linear maps f,g € HomF(U, V) in the standard
way, namely
(f + g)(u) I f(u) + 5'01),
and the multiplication by scalars in F by
(@001) I (11‘(11),
foranyu€Uanda€F.
Prove the following result!
Proposition 5
For any two vector spaces U and V over the same fie/d F, HomF(U, V)
with the two operations as defined above is a vector space over F.

The matrix of a linear map
Let U and V be vector spaces over a field F, with bases {x1, . . . 7xm} and
{y1,...,y,,}, respectively. Assume that the two bases are totally ordered
by the index of its vectors.
Any f G Hom;:(U7 V) is completely and uniquely specified by a matrix
YI Yn
f(X1) 81,1 81,”
Af I 5 5 5 5
{(Xm) am,1 ' ' ' 3mm
where f(x,-) : aijlyl + - - - + a,-7,,y,,, for all i.
Af is called the matrix of the linear map f.
A; depends on the bases of U and V, as well as the vectors’ order in the
two bases!

V. For instance, [x] : (a1, . . --,04m), [f(x1)] : (21,1, . . . ., 217”), and so on.

Evaluating linear maps by their matrices
When the vector identifies itself with its coordinate, that is [z] I z, we
obtain f(x) : fo. The next example illustrate this.
Example 6
Let F be a ﬁeld and f 6 HomF(F2, F3) given by
f(X,y) I (X + 3y, 2X + 5y, 7X + 9Y)
Considering the standard bases of F2 and F3, we have
f(1,0) : (1,2,7) and f(0, 1) I (3,5,9). So,
Af I 1 2 7
3 5 9
Then, f(3,2) I (3 2) Af z (9,16,39).

Linear maps and matrices

Uniquely identifying a linear map with a matrix leads to the following
result.
Proposition 7
Let U and V be vector spaces over a fie/d F with dim(U) : m and
dim( V) I n. Then, Homp(U, V) is isomorphic to mF”.
Proof.
See textbook [1] pages 362-363. U
Some authors represent vectors in column format and not row as we have
adopted. In the linear map matrix Af, the vectors f(x,-) are then
represented by columns of the matrix. The calculations then change via
the matrix transpose operation!

The null space and the range of a linear map
Definition 8
Let f Q HomF(U, V).
1. The null space of f, denoted N(f), is the subset of U consisting of
all vectors u such that f(u) : 0.
2. The range of f, denoted RU), is the subset of V consisting of all
vectors v G V such that f(u) : v for some u G U.
Prove the following properties!

Fundamental theorem of linear maps
Theorem 10 (Fundamental theorem of linear maps)
Let f € HomF(U, V). Then,

dim(U) I dim(N(f)) + dim(R(f)).

Proof.
Let n : dim(U) and k : dim(N(f)). Given a basis Bl of NU) extend
it to a basis B of U.
Prove that f(BZ), where 52 : B \ Bl, is a basis of RU). U
Our assumption in this course was that all vector spaces we work with
have finite bases. The fundamental theorem of linear maps remains valid
even if V is infinite-dimensional (but U finite-dimensional)!

Inner product
The inner product, also called the scalar product, of two vectors in a
vector space is a binary operation that allows defining the length
(magnitude) of a vector and the angle between two vectors.
The definition of an inner product on a vector space depends a lot on its
field of scalars:
o Whether or not it is endowed with an involutory automorphism to
capture the conjugation aspects that appear, for example, in (C;
o Whether or not it is endowed with a total order to capture the
aspect of positive semi-definiteness;
o Whether or not it allows an extension to positive deﬁniteness.

R” is
n
<(X1,-..,Xn),(y1,-..,yn)> z 2w,-

<x,y> is offten written as x ' y, which justifies the name of “dot product"!
The clot product allows computing the length of a vector and the angle
between two vectors in R2:

Properties of the dot product in R"
The dot product on vectors in R” has many useful properties:
1. Symmetry: (X,y> : <y.x>, for all X,y € R”;
2. Linearity: <ax + ﬂy,z> : oz<x72> + ﬁ<y,z>, for all x,y,z G R” and
a, 5 G R. Combining with the symmetry we get bi-Iinearity;
3. Non-degeneracy: if <x,y> : O for all y, then x : O;
4. Positive semi-definite: <x,x> Z O, for all x € R”;
5. Positive definite: add “<X,X> : 0 iff X : O” to the positive
semi-definiteness.
Clearly, positive definiteness implies non-degeneracy.

Generalizing the dot product
The generalization of the dot product to vector spaces over arbitrary
fields should be made with great care. A few facts are in order:
0 For C”, the dot product is defined in a different way:
f7
<(X17 ' ' '7Xf7)7(.y11' ' - myﬂ» I ZXI'YI'
1:1
and so the properties above need to be adapted (2 stands for the
complex conjugate);
0 ln finite fields, such as Zp with p prime, the requirement
<X,X> :0 iffx: O
does not usually hold. For instance, if V I Zg,
<(1,2),(1,2)> : 1 +4 E O mod 5
o On arbitrary fields, the condition <x,x> Z O does not make any sense
(unless we define a total order relation).

Inner product
Definition 11
Let V be a vector space over a field F. An inner product on V is a
function <-, -> : V >< V e F such that:
1- <X>y> Z <y7><>;
2- (@X + 5y, Z> I <1<X7 Z> + 601%
for any X,y,z G V and onﬂ G F.
As we can see, the deﬁnition borrows only the properties of symmetry
and linearity in the first argument from the dot product. This is not the
most general definition, but it satisfies our needs.

Orthogonality
Definition 12
Let V be a vector space over a field F. The vectors X,y G V are called
orthogonal, denoted X L y, if <X,y> I O.
Let x E V and X7 Y Q V. We define:
1. xiYifxiy, forallyE Y;
2. XiYifxl Y, foralleX;
3. Xi I {z G V l z L X} — this is the orthogonal complement of X.
Remark 13
0 The orthogonal complement of a set of vectors is always a subspace
of V;
0 X Q (Xi-H, for all X Q V. ln R and (C we can prove the equality
when X is a sub-space.
