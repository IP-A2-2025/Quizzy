Information security: more important than ever!
“By reverse-engineering the communications between a Tesla
Model Y and its credit card key, they were able to properly exe-
cute a range-extending relay attack against the crossover. While
this specific use case focuses on Tesla, it's a proof of concept —
NFC handshakes can, and eventual/y will, be reverse-engineered. "

Security properties
According to the NIST Computer Security Handbook from Guttman and
Roback (1995) (see also Nieles et al. (2017)), infOrmation security rests
on three security properties (the CIA triad):
.\@
e 6
s a
.1? ‘gal
s e
Q .
OD Information
Security
Availability
Additional security properties are needed nowadays to capture current
requirements better:
0 Authentication;
0 Accountability.
The interpretation of these security properties vary, depending on the
context in which they arise.

Confidentiality, integrity, and availability
0 Confidentiality — or secrecy, has a number of different meanings:

o A very strict interpretation: the intruder should not be able to
deduce anything about the legitimate users’ activity (this is closely
related to privacy);

o In most cases: the intruder is not able to derive the plaintext of
messages passing between honest users;

o Integrity — is usually taken to mean that data cannot be corrupted,
or at least that any such corruption will always be detected;
o Availability — refers to the ability to use the information or resource
(data or service) desired.

***************page number:8**************
Authentication and accountability
0 Authentication — this property embraces several forms such as:

o Authentication of origin — taken to mean that we can be sure that a
message that purports to be from a certain party was indeed
originated by that party;

o Entity authentication;

o Key authentication;

o Accountability — there are many definitions for what it means to be
accountable. One of them is:

o Accountability should guarantee that the actions of an entity are
traced uniquely to that entity.

Other security properties

0 Non-repudiation — prevents either sender or receiver from denying a
transmitted message;

0 Fairness — occasionally, protocols are required to enforce certain
fairness properties. In electronic contract signing, for example, we
want to avoid one of the participants being able to gain some
advantages over another by halting the protocol partway through;

o Anonymity — intuitively, a system that is anonymous over some set
of events E should have the property that when an event from E
occurs then an observer, though he may be able to deduce that an
event from E has occurred, will be unable to identify which.

Security threats and attacks

***************Ending Page***************


***************Beginning Page***************
***************page number:11**************
Security threat, vulnerability, attack

o A security threat is a potential violation of security;

0 A security violation need not occur for there to be a threat;

0 /-\ vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a system's design,
implementation, or operation and management that could be
exploited to violate the system's security policy;

o Those actions that could cause a security violation to occur are
called attacks;

o Those who execute attacks, or cause their execution, are called
attackers 0r intruders.

Intruders
The objective of an intruder is to gain access to a system or to increase
the range of privileges accessible on a system. Taxonomy of intruders:

o outsider: acts against the system from outside;

o insider: acts against the system from inside. Usually, an insider is
more powerful than an outsider because he/she is a legitimate user
who can have access to data, programs, or other resources;

0 passive intruder: read messages and deduce information from them
using public information;

o active intruder: can read messages, compose new messages, and
send them in the system;

o coalition of individuals: an intruder is not necessarily just one
individual. l\/lore individuals may share their common knowledge
(public and secret) in order to get specific information.

Classes of security threats
A classiﬁcation of security threats according to Shirey (2000) (see also
Shirey (2007)) and based on threat consequences:
0 disclosure — unauthorized access to information;
0 deception — acceptance of false data;
0 disruption — interruption or prevention of correct operation;
0 usurpation — unauthorized control of some part of a system.

Examples of practical attacks
0 Passive eavesdropping, sniffing, snooping
o unauthorized interception of information;
o it is a form of disclosure;
o it is passive;
0 (passive) wiretapping is a form of snooping;
0 Modification/alteration (sometimes called active eavesdropping,
sniffing, or snooping)
0 unauthorized interception and change of information;
o it may be a form of deception, disruption, or usurpation;
o it is active;
o active wiretapping is a form of modification;
o Masquerading/spoofing

Social engineering attacks
In information security, social engineering is a form of psychological
manipulation of people to determine them performing some actions 0r
divulging confidential information.
Examples of attacks:
o Phishing;
o Vishing (voice phishing);
o Smishing (SMS phishing).

Attack strategies
Three well-known strategies an intruder might employ to attack the
security of a system are in order:
o Man-in-the-middle;
o lnterleave;
o Attacks that exploit design properties or software or hardware
implementation properties.
Security analysis should not depend on knowing any attack strategy!
However, in practice, the security analysis is often done by considering
the resistance to certain classes of attacks. Why? Because a general
security analysis is practically infeasible in most cases.

Example of man-in-the-middle attack
This style of attack involves the intruder imposing himself between the
communications between two parties. For instance, let us consider the
following protocol based on a commutative cipher (Ku denotes user U's
secret key).
Protocol 1 (Shamir's no-key protocol / Shamir's three-pass
protocol)
1. A —> B : {X}Ka
2. B 4) A I {{X}K3}Kb
3. A —> B : {X}Kb
Goal: A sends X to B without knowing B's secret key.
Correctness of step 3: — (by commutativity).

Man-in-the-middle cont'd
Attack 1 (Man-in-the-middle attack on Shamis’s protocol)
o C intercepts the first message, encrypts it
{{X}Ka}Kc7
and returns it to A;
0 C intercepts {X}Kc from A and recovers X.
Prevention of the attack — impossible over public Abelian groups: Onur
et al. (2017).
For cryptographic protocols preventing the man-in-the-middle attack
please see Katz (2002).

Example of interleave attack
This attack is based on impersonating legal users and interleave runs in
the protocol. For instance, let us consider the Needham-Schroeder
public-key protocol (Nu denotes U's nonce, and KL, is U's public key).
Protocol 2 (Needham-Schroeder public key protocol)
1. A —> B: A, B,{Na,A}Kb
2. B —> A: B,A, {Na7 Nb}Ka
3. A —> B: A, B,{Nb}Kb
Goal: A and B agree on the values of Na and Nb, and no one else knows
these values.

Lowe's attack
Attack 2 (Lowe (1995))
1. A e C: A, C,{N3,A}KC
2. C(A) —> B: A, B,{Na,A}Kb
3. B —> C(A): B,A,{N=_,,,Nb};<a
4. C—>A. C,A,{N2,Nb}Ka
6. C(A) —> B: A, B,{Nb};<b
Where C is a recognized user, that is, he is known to the other users and
has a certified public key. At the end of this:
o A thinks that he and C exclusively share knowledge of Na and Nb;
0 B thinks that he and A exclusively share knowledge of Na and Nb.
Prevention of the attack — add identity of sender in step 2:
A7 57 {N37 Nbv B}Ka

Example of attack exploiting faulty implementation
Faulty implementations of cryptographic protocols can provide valuable
information to an intruder that can use them to break the system. The
following example is due to a personal communication of Lenstra (see
Boneh et al. (1997) and Boneh (1999)).
Protocol 3 (Encrypted communication by RSA)
public n (n : pq factoring intractable)
secret p7 q (large prime numbers)
n7 e5 dB

Lenstra's attack
Attack 3 (Lenstra's attack)
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, x is the unique solution of the
system
x E xp mod p
x E Xq mod q,
where xp : ydB mOd (p_1) mod p and xq I ydB m°d (q_1) mod q.
Assume xp was computed correctly, but not xq, and let x’ be the result
obtained by the receiver by this erroneous decryption. X/ is meaningless
and, therefore, the receiver throw it away. If the intruder (C) is able to
get x’, then the intruder can recover p by the equation
p : (((x’)eB — y) mod n, n).
In such a case, the cryptosystem is complete/y broken.

Formal analysis of security protocols
The difficulty of designing and analyzing security protocols stems from a
number of considerations:
0 The properties they are supposed to ensure are extremely subtle;
o These protocols inhabit a complex, hostile environment;
o Capturing the capabilities of intruders is inevitable extremely
difficult;
o By their very nature security protocols involve a high degree of
concurrency.
These facts lead to the undecidability of many security properties when
studied on unrestricted protocols. On restricted protocols, they can
become decidable, but even with severe restrictions, the complexity of
their decision is very high. (see, for example Tiplea et al. (2005), Tiplea
et al. (2008), Tiplea et al. (2013)).
