If Tom knew Alice's key, then Tom would be able to authenticate
documents in place of Alice.

Why public key cryptography?
Two main objectives that cannot be achieved by symmetric-key
cryptography:

o _ — A private conversation between
two people with no prior acquaintance is a common occurrence in
business, and it is unrealistic to expect initial business contacts to be
postponed long enough for keys to be transmitted by some physical
means;

o — — In current business, the validity of
contracts is guaranteed by signatures. ls there any purely digital
replacement of the handwritten signature?

A bit of history
o 1976: Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, and independently Ralph
Merkle, invented public key cryptography to address the two
aforementioned deficiencies;
o The first concrete realization of a public key cryptosystem is due to
R.C. Merkle and ME. Hellman in 1978. Unfortunately, this
cryptosystem, as well as many other variations of it, have been
proved to be insecure;
0 Soon after the Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem came the first
full-fledged public key cryptosystem, RSA (named after its inventors,
R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman). RSA is by far the easiest to
understand and implement public key cryptosystem; it gets its
security from the difficulty of factorization of very large numbers.

Security models for PKE
We define and use the same security models based on indistinguishability
and non-malleability as in the case of symmetric encryption. However, we
draw attention to:

1. No deterministic PKE scheme can be IND-CPA secure — the
adversary can consult the encryption oracle any time and,therefore,
it can decide what message was encrypted

2. No PKE scheme can achieve perfect security — given a message m
and a ciphertext c, and assuming 0 < P(m) < l, and unbounded
adversary can decide whether c comes from m or not. That is,
P(m|c) is O or 1. Then, P(mlc) 7£ P(m)

0 p and q are large numbers randomly generated (512-bit or even
larger)
0 e is small (fast encryption) but chosen such that d > (‘m (otherwise,
an efficient attack can be mounted — details will be provided later)
o The RSA PKE scheme is not IND-CPA (encrytion is deterministic)
o If one of p, q, ¢(n), or d can be computed in a reasonable time,
then the system is completely broken
o If the same n is used by two different users, any one of them can
break the other's encryption

Padded RSA
Public key Cryptography Standard # 1 (PKCS # 1) provides
recommendations for implementing the RSA algorithms. The current
version is v.2.2 (Oct 2012):

0X00 |l 0X02 |l r || 0x00 || m

where m is the message and r is a random string (the length of the
above message must be exactly the length of the modulus n, in bytes).
Moreover, no byte of r is 0x00. The second byte (0x02) denotes
"encryption".
Bleichenbacher (1998) described an attack on PKCS # 1, v.1.5, known
today as Bleichenbacher's attack. Subsequently, new attacks were found
Coron et al. (2000); lzu et al. (2007); Bardou et al. (2012); Bock et al.
(2018).

Digital Signatures
A digital signature scheme is a method of signing a digital message
There are several differences between digital signatures and handwritten
signatures:
o a digital signature is not attached physically to the message it signs;
o a digital signature depends on the message;
0 a digital signature is verified by taking into consideration the
message it signs;
0 a digital signature scheme should be private, but publicly verifiable.
A digital signature should be “small” so that it can be used 0n smart
cards. Therefore, for long messages, a hash function should be applied
first

Digital Signature Standard

0 Digital Signature Standard (DSS) is the American standard for
digital signatures;

0 DSS was proposed by NIST in 1991, and adopted in 1994;

o DSS is a variation of the ElGamal digital signature. This variation is
based on the following remark: the prime p in the ElGamal digital
signature should be a 512-bit or 1024-bit number in order to ensure
security. This fact leads to signatures that are too large t0 be used
on smart cards;

o DSS modiﬁes EIGamal digital signature so that the computations are
done in a subgroup Zq of Z; by using an element a € Z; of order q.

Goal reduce the size of encryption keys While maintaining the level of
security. For instance, a 256-bit key in ECC offers about the same
security as a 3072-bit RSA public key
Why Recent research in computational number theory lead to increased
security requirements which, in turn, require larger public keys

Discrete logarithm problem on EC
Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)
Instance: Elliptic curve E and two points P and mP on E
Question: Compute m
Facts:
1. No sub-exponential algorithms are known to solve general-purpose
ECDLP (but they are known for DLP over finite fields!)
2. All ECC schemes are public key and are based on ECDLP. Most of
them are ECC versions of classical schemes
3. The absence of sub-exponential algorithms to solve the
general-purpose ECDLP implies that the ECDLP-based
cryptographic schemes can use smaller fields than those based on
DLP on finite fields. As a result, the cryptographic keys have smaller
sizes

X.509 certification scheme
How does Alice obtain Bob's public key?
In general, how can public keys for encryption or verification of digital
signatures be distributed in an authenticated way?
0 Kohnfelder (1978) introduced in his B.Sc. thesis the concepts of
certificate and certificate revocation list
0 /-\ certificate binds an identity to a public key
o X.509 is a standard for defining public key certificates
o X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols
A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a collection of tools (roles, policies,
hardware and/or software tools) needed to create, manage, distribute,
use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public key
encryption.

root. The last certificate in a certificate chain is called a trust anchor for
the first certificate.

Root CA signs CA-l's certificate,
