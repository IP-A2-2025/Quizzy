Domain Name System
1. Internet domain
o ls a collection of data-l- describing a self-contained administrative
and technical unit on the Internet;
o Can comprise computer addresses, services (such as e-mail or FTP),
resource (such as hypertext documents), and more;
2. Domain name : identification string for an Internet domain;
3. Domain Name System (DNS) I hierarchical and decentralized
naming system for Internet domains.
DNS is the “phone-book" of the Internet!

Domain Name System
1. DNS was proposed in the early 1980s by Paul V. Mockapetris;
2. DNS original speciﬁcations were published in 1983 in RFC 882 and
RFC 883;
3. DNS became an Internet Standard in 1986 (RFC 1034 and RFC
1035).
The DNS has three major components:
1. The domain name space and resource records I set of information
tree-like structured;
2. Name servers : server programs which hold information about the
domain tree's structure and set information;
3. Resolvers I programs that extract information from name servers.

Zones of authority and name servers
1. The DNS name space is comprised logically of domain names but
physically of zones;
2. Zones are obtained by making cuts between adjacent nodes of the
DNS name tree to create groups of contiguous nodes in the tree;
3. Each group is called a zone of authority;
4. Each zone is usually identified by the domain name of the highest
level node in the zone;
5. The zones are non-overlapping;
6. Every zone is managed by one or more pairs (primary/master,
secondary/slave) of authoritative name servers;
7. A name server may be authoritative for more than one zone.

Resource Records (RR)
1. Each node in the DNS name tree has associated a number of
records, usually called resource records (RR), depending on the node
type;
2. The RRs are added, changed, or deleted when DNS information
changes (this is done by administrators);
3. The set of all RRs gives rise to a distributed database that is
structured in a hierarchy comparable to the hierarchy of authorities.

Some DNS RR types
SOA I Start Of Authority
o Every zone has exactly one SOA RR, at the beginning of the zone;
o lt holds information about the zone, such as:
o Default TTL for everything in the zone;
o Primary name server;
o The e-mail address of the person responsible for administering the
domain's zone file.
Example 1
google.com. 900 IN SOA nsl.google.com
dns-admin.google.com

Some DNS RR types
NS I Name Server
o Specifies the name of the authoritative DNS name server for the
zone;
o Each zone must have at least one NS RR that points to its primary
name server, and that name must also have a valid A RR.
A : Address
0 Contains a 32-bit lP address (it is the lP address of the node, stored
for the resolution process).
MX : Mail eXchanger
0 Specifies the location (device name) that is responsible for handling
e-mail sent to the domain, and that location must have a valid A RR.

DNS resolution
1. Most typical types of resolution:
1.1 (Standard) name resolution : determine the IP address of a domain
name;
1.2 Reverse name resolution : determine the domain name associated
with an IP address;
1.3 e-mail resolution I determine where to send the e-mail messages
based on the e-mail address used in a message;
2. DNS name resolution techniques:
2.1 Iterative resolution;
2.2 Recursive resolution (not all name servers support recursion,
especially servers near the top of the hierarchy).

DNS vulnerabilities
S. Bellovin: Using the Domain Name System for System Break-ins,
Proceedings of the Fifth USENIX UNIX Security Symposium Salt
Lake City, Utah, June 1995
Author's note: this paper has been withheld by the author
for over four years because it described a serious vulnerability
for which there was no feasible fix. The only choice would have
been to give up entirely on name based authentication, a choice
the industry was not able to make in 1990. ”

What is DNSsec?
1. After Bellovin's paper, securing DNS became a fundamental issue;
2. Proposed DNSsec standards: RFC 4033, 4034, 4035 (in 2005).
DNSsec is an extension of DNS that adds:

o Data origin authentication — allows a resolver to cryptographically
verify that the data it has received actually came from the zone
where it believes the data originated;

0 Data integrity protection — allows the resolver to know that the data
has not been modified in transit since it was originally signed by the
zone owner with the zone's private key.

New RR types
DNSsec uses four new types of RRs:
0 RRSIG (RR SlGnature) — stores a digital signature over an RRset;
o DNSKEY (DNS public KEY) — stores a public key for digital
signature verification;
o NSEC/NSEC3 (Next SECure) — used to prove that something really
does not exist;
0 DS (Delegation Signer)— stores a hash value of a verification public
key.

Canonical ordering of DNS names (RFC 4034)
For the purposes of DNSsec:
1. Owner names are ordered by treating individual labels as unsigned
left-justified octet strings;
2. The absence of a octet sorts before a zero value octet;
3. Uppercase US-ASCII letters are treated as lowercase;
4. Start by sorting the names according to their rightmost labels;
5. For names in which the most significant label is identical, continue
sorting according to their next most significant label, and so forth.

Canonical RR ordering in an RRset (RFC 4034)
For the purposes of DNSsec:

1. RRs with the same owner name, class, and type are sorted by
treating the RDATA portion of the canonical form of each RR as a
left-justified unsigned octet sequence in which the absence of an
octet sorts before a zero octet;

2. If a DNSsec implementation detects duplicate RRs when putting the
RRset in canonical form, it must treat this as a protocol error or
remove all but one of the duplicate RR(s) for the purposes of
calculating the canonical form of the RRset.

ZSK vs. KSK
Public keys in DNSsec have two fundamental uses: to sign a zone, called
in this case zone signing keys (ZSK), and to validate a ZSK, called in this
case key signing keys (KSK).
The "flags" field differentiates between the two classes of keys:
1. If flag 7 is 1, the key is used for signing the zone;
2. If flag 15 is 1, the key is used to validate a ZSK.
Example 2
When the flags field value is 256 (meaning that only flag 7 is 1), the
key is for zone signing, and when it is 257 (both flags 7 and 15 are 1),
the key is both for zone and key signing.
KSKs are used to validate ZSKs and create a chain of trust starting from
the root to the desired node.

Zone signing
To sign a zone means to include DNSKEY RRs, RRSIG RRs, NSEC RRs,
and optionally DS RRs in that zone, according to the following rules:

o To sign a zone, zone's admin generates one or more (public,private)
keys and uses the private keys to sign authoritative RRsets. For each
private key used to create RRSIG RRs, a corresponding DNSKEY
RR should be included in the zone;

0 Suppose the signed zone must be linked to the parent zone. ln that
case, the zone validation keys (DNSKEY RRs) must be signed by a
KSK, its veriﬁcation key (of DNSKEY RRs) must be present in the
zone, and a DS RR of it must be in the parent zone at the
delegation point (separation entry point);

0 Each owner name in the zone that has authoritative data 0r a
delegation point NS RRset, must have an NSEC resource record.

More on zone signing can be found in RFC 4035.

Zone enumeration
The NSEC RR introduces a side-effect in that the contents of a zone can
be enumerated:
0 An NSEC record lists two names that are ordered canonically, in
order to show that nothing exists between the two names;
0 The complete set of NSEC records lists all the names in a zone;
o To enumerate the content of a zone, query for names that do not
exist!
The enumeration of a zone can be used:
0 As a source of probable e-mail addresses for spam, or
o As a key for multiple WHOIS queries to reveal registrant data that
many registries may have legal obligations to protect.

extremely high.

***************page number:42**************
Concluding remarks
o DNSsec is a critical service on the Internet;
o ICANN has been supporting DNSsec deployment for many years
through various initiatives and capacity-building programs;
o According to APNIC, only 30% of the world has achieved DNSsec
validation;
o Countries with exceptionally high validation rates: Saudi Arabia
(98%), Finland (94%), Iceland (88%), Norway (86%), and Sweden
(86%);
o Despite the slow adoption, DNSSEC remains the only real option for
preventing cache poisoning attacks.
The slow deployment of DNSsec is due to the lack of knowledge about
the security problems generated by DNS and the lack of requirements for
implementing this technology.
