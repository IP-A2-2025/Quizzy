Security models for symmetric encryption
Recall that a security model is a pair consisting of a security goal X and
an attack model Y, usually written as X-Y.
1. Semantic security (SS);
2. lndistinguishability (IND);
3. Non-malleability (NM).
1. Chosen plaintext attack (CPA);
2. Non-adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCAl);
3. Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCAZ).

Security goals
1. Semantic security

1.1 Proposed by Goldwasser and l\/|ica|i (1984), it was the first definition
of security for encryption;

1.2 It formalizes the fact that no adversary can obtain any partial
information about the message of a given ciphertext (whatever can
efficiently be computed about a message from its ciphertext can also
be computed without the ciphertext);

1.3 It is a “polynomially bounded" version of the concept of perfect
secrecy introduced by Shannon (1949);

1.4 It is complex and difficult to work with;

2. lndistinquishability is an equivalent definition to semantic security
which is somewhat simpler;
3. Non-malleability means that, given a ciphertext c of some message
m, no efficient adversary can construct another ciphertext c’ of
some message m’ meaningfully related to m.

Attack models
1. Passive attacks:
1.1 Cipher-only attack (COA): A has access to the ciphertext;
1.2 Known plaintext attack (KPA): A knows pairs (plaintext,ciphertext);
2. Active attacks:

2.1 Chosen plaintext attack (CPA): A has access to the encryption
oracle (this is for free for PKE);

2.2 Non-adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCAl): A has, in addition
to the ability of a CPA adversary, access to a decryption oracle
before the challenge phase;

2.3 Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCAZ): A has, in addition to the
ability of a CCAl adversary, access to a decryption oracle after the
challenge phase. However, no decryption query is allowed involving
the challenge ciphertext.

Proving security by indistinguishability
lndistinguishability, as a security model, requires that an adversary from a
specific class of adversaries interact with the cryptographic scheme under
the security study, as follows:
Training The adversary trains with the scheme according to his
type;

Challenge At a given moment, the adversary will choose 2 (different)
messages of equal length and will receive the ciphertext of
one of them (chosen randomly uniformly);

Training Depending on the class to which the adversary belongs, he
can still train with the scheme;
Guess The adversary will have to decide from which of the two

messages the ciphertext comes.

lf the guessing probability is non-negligible greater than 1/2, then the

adversary wins the game, which means that the scheme is not secure for

adversaries in this class.

Relationships among security models

1. lND-COA (also called indistinguishability in the presence of an
eavesdropper) is the weakest form of security where the adversary
can only eavesdrop on ciphertexts;

2. lND-KPA (also called indistinguishability under multiple encryption
attack) is stronger than lND-COA;

3. The diagram below only aims to create an image on the
relationships between the other security models (some of these
relationships are far from trivial).

Stream ciphers

0 The message is viewed as a sequence of blocks (also called
characters) of a very limited size, that can efficiently be enumerated
in practice (e.g., bits or bytes);

o The secret key is expanded to a keystream of the same size as the
message block size by a keystream generator initially seeded with the
secret key;

0 The encryption is block-driven ;

0 One-time pad (OTP) may be regarded as a stream cipher, but a
quite impractical one.

Stream ciphers: using the same key twice

0 lf c1 I m1 EB G(K) and c2 I m2 69 G(K), then c1 G9 c2 I m1 63 m2;

0 Natural language text contains enough redundancy to allow the
adversary to recover m1 and m2 from c1 EB c2 .

o Microsoft implementation of PPTP in Windows NT uses RC4. lts
original implementation uses the same key to encrypt messages from
A to B and from B to A (see Scl\/lu1998.pdf on the course site);

o Microsoft have used RC4 to protect Word and Excel document.
When encrypted documents were modified and saved, the same key
was used (see Wu2005.pdf on the course site).

Never use the same key to encrypt more than one message with stream
ciphers !

Stream ciphers: malleability
0 From an encryption c : m 69 G(K) of m one can simply obtain an
encryption of m 65 m’ by c’ : c ® m’.
o Assume that the adversary knows a preﬁx m1 of m (m1 might be a
standard header filled with someone's address, name, etc.);
0 The adversary wants to replace m1 by m2 (m2 might be a header
filled with information up to his desire);
o The adversary may compute c 69 (m1 69 m2)0 - - - 0 to obtain what he
wants.

The stream cipher RC4
1. RC4 was proposed by Ronald Rivest in 1987 as a trade secret but
posted anonymously in September 1994 on a mailing list;
2. RC4 was used in a large variety of applications: SSL/TLS, WEP,
WPA, MS-PPTP etc.;
3. Recent results have shown that the RC41gen output is biased (see
AlFardan et al. (2013)):

frames (a frame is 2745 bits long) and 238 computations to recover
the key (see Lu et al. (2005));

Block ciphers
l-\n intensively used method to encrypt a message is the next one:
l. View the message as a sequence of blocks of a larger size so that the
enumeration of all blocks is infeasible in practice;
2. lteratively encrypt each message block by another block.
Remark 2
1. The encryption of a message block by another block is done by
families of permutations (i.e., block ciphers) or families of functions;
2. The iteration method is crucial and it is called mode of operation;
3. In the encryption process of a message block, the encryption key is
expanded to a fixed number of round keys.

Pseudo-random functions
A pseudo-random function (PRF) is a family J: of functions with the
following properties:

1. Efficiently computable: Each function f G J: can be computed by a
deterministic poly-time algorithm;

2. Pseudo-randomness: If we randomly choose a function from this
family then its input-output behavior is computationally
indistinguishable from that of a random function.

The adversary is allowed to train with f G .7 to establish the
pseudo-randomness of f (see “indistinguishability”)l

Looking for collisions
Theorem 9
Let m be the number of possible message digests of a hash function H
under some key K. If we compute message digests for r messages
chosen uniform/y at random and
Lx/2cmj < r < m
for some real constant c > 0, then the probability to get a collision is
higher than 1 — e_C (e is Euler's number, e : 2.71828 - - -.)
Example 10
Let m : 240 and r such that 1.200.000 z L220\/2 In 2] < r < 24°.
The probability of getting a collision is greater than 1/2. Therefore,
40-bit message digests do not ensure security.

lfh and h’ given by h’(K, m) : h(m7 K) are PRFs, then FH is a PRF.
For a proof of this theorem please see Boneh and Shoup (2020).
The HMAC construction uses one single key K from which two keys are
derived: K1 : K QB ipad and K2 : K G9 opad.
HMAC-SHAl and HMAC-SHA256 are instances of the above
construction, with H : SHAl and H : SHA256, respectively.

The need for authenticated encryption
Combining secure encryption schemes with secure MACs may lead to
error-prone systems (see Krawczyk (2001), Bernstein (2013))
Definition 15
Let S be a cipher.
1. S provides ciphertext integrity (Cl) if no adversary can output valid
ciphertexts, except with negligible probability.
2. S provides authenticated encryption (AE) if:
2.1 S is IND-CPA secure
2.2 S provides Cl.
Theorem 16
If S is AE secure then it is IND-C CA secure.

Constructing AE secure ciphers
One popular way to construct AE secure ciphers is to combine an
IND-CPA secure cipher with a secure MAC. There are two main variants:
1. Encrypt-then-MAC (Ethl)
1.1 c <— 5(K, m), t <— Tg(K’, c), output (c, t);
1.2 Used in lPsec, TLS 1.2 and later versions, and in the NIST standard
GClVl;
2. MAC-then-Encrypt (IVItE)
2.1 t <— 7ﬂg(K’7 m), c <- S(K, (m7 t)), output c;
2.2 Used in SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, and in 802.11i WiFi encryption protocol.
The keys K and K’ are chosen independently!

Encrypt-then-MAC
Theorem 17
lfS is an IND-CPA secure cipher and S’ is a secure MAC, then the
Et/VI construction is a secure AE.
Common mistakes in implementing the Ethl construction:
l. Use the same key for the cipher and the MAC;
2. Apply the MAC only to part of the ciphertext (we may loose
ciphertext integrity) — discovered in 2013 at RNCryptor facility in
Apple's iOS.

MAC-then-Encrypt
MtE is not generally secure:
1. The attack POODLE on SSL 3.0;
2. Padding oracle timing attack in TLS 1.0;
3. Informative error messages in TLS 1.0.
1. The randomized counter mode of the cipher assures AE security.
