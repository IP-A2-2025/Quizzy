Role-based Access Control
- Access to objects is regulated by the role user has in an
organization.
A bit of history:
o Formal approaches to access control were initiated in the early 19705
through DAC and MAC:

o lVlAC was introduced based on military security needs, which
sometimes makes it unsuitable for civilian applications. For example,
MAC cannot properly enforce access control based on competencies,
conflict-of-interest rules, or a strict concept of least privilege;

o DAC has a focus on civilian applications, but it assumes that subjects
own the resources. However, the resources are not owned by subjects
in companies (organizations, corporations, agencies, enterprises);

Role-based Access Control
A bit of history (cont):

o A solution to meet these needs was proposed by Ferraiolo and Kuhn
(1992) in the form of a non-discretionary access control model called
role-based access control (RBAC);

0 Later, Sandhu et al. (1996) introduced a framework for RBAC
models, commonly known as RBAC96, also establishing a modular
structure;

o Following a NIST initiative to reach an international consensus for
the use of RBAC, Sandhu et al. (2000) proposed an RBAC standard.
The standard was approved in 2004 and adopted as lNClTS
359-2004 (NIST model for RBAC);

0 The revision initiated in 2010 by NIST adds attributes to RBAC
(Kuhn et al. (2010)). The latest version of the standard is INCITS
359-2012.

***************Beginning Page***************
***************page number:7**************
RBAC components
An RBAC model can be viewed as consisting of two separate but
dependent classes of components:
0 Static components: users, roles, permissions, and the relations
between them;
o Dynamic components: subjects, role authorization, and object
access authorization.

Users, roles, permissions
User — any person who interacts directly with a computer
system;
Role — a set of actions and responsibilities associated with a
particular working activity;
Permission — a description of (a type of) authorized access to
resources or to do something:

0 The RBAC model accommodates many
interpretations for permissions. The nature of a
permission depends on system and implementation;

o Permissions are positive: they confer the ability to
perform actions in system;

o Constraints will model the prohibition to execute an
action (some authors name them negative
permissions).

Roles vs. groups and compartments

o Organizations operate based on roles: identifying roles (as sets of
permissions) in a system is more priority than identifying groups (as
sets of users). This leads to the advantage of simplifying the
understanding and management of permissions in the system. For
instance, enumerating all permissions for roles is easy;

o Roles add a useful level of abstraction and may be more stable than
groups;

o Groups are implementation-specific. For example, a file can be
associated with only one group in some operating systems, while in
others, a file can be associated with several groups. But the role is
defined by permissions offered to users who receive it, which makes
the role independent of implementation;

o The compartments in a lattice-based model allow one-way
information flow based on a specific policy. Roles are not associated
with any policy.

Subjects and sessions

o A session is an instance of a user's dialog with a system;

o A subject is a running computer program (process) acting on behalf
of a user;

o As user's actions on a computer system are performed through some
programs running on the computer, we often identify subjects and
sessions.

Inheritance schemes
Role inheritance schemes may be defined in various ways, such as:
o Permission-based inheritance — here, the role is viewed just as a set
of permissions. Then,
0 User- and permission-based inheritance — here, the role is viewed
both as a set of permissions and a set of users. Then,
r1 z r2 e RP(r2) g RP(r1) /\ UR_1(r1) g UR_1(r2)
o User-based inheritance — here, permissions are assigned to groups
and groups are mapped to roles. Then,
r1 2 r2 <=> UR_1(r1) Q UR_1(r2)

Role authorized users and permissions
An user u is authorized for a role r if u has assigned a role r’ that
inherits r. The set 0f users authorized for the role r is
{uE U|Hr’: (u,r/) G UR /\ r'Z r}.
Users with more powerful roles may play less powerful roles!
A permission p is authorized for a role r if p is assigned to a role r’
inherited by r. The set of permissions authorized for the role r is
{p€ P|Er’: (r’,p)€ RP /\ Hg r}.
Permissions of less powerful roles are available to more powerful roles!

Constraints play an essential role in shaping a system. They can

o bring more power.
In RBAC; constraints play a significant role. They can help

0 control the assignment of roles per user 0r permissions per role:
o number or roles/permissions;

Separation of duty
American National Standards Institute: Separation of Duty (SoD) means
“Dividing responsibility for sensitive information so that no individual
acting alone can compromise the security of the data processing system."
There exists a great variety of SoD models (see Simon and Zurko
(1997)). Two broad categories of SoD methods are:
o static (SSD) — place constraints on roles at the time users are
authorized for roles, and
o dynamic (DSD) — are invoked when the users are actively using the
system.

Concluding remarks

o RBAC simpliﬁes security administration by using roles, hierarchies,
and constraints;

0 RBAC reduces costs within an organization because it takes into
account that employees change much more frequently than the
duties Within positions;

0 RBAC can be configured to support a large variety of access control
policies, including DAC and MAC policies;

o RBAC is suited to a large variety of applications and software system
environments.
