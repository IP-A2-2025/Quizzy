Access control: who can do what
0 Access control — guards, gates, locks;
o Access control in computing — the way in which users can access
resources in a computer system;
0 Access control — the most fundamental and most pervasive security
mechanism in use today;
0 Access control shows up in virtually all systems, can take many
forms, and acts at different levels:
o Hardware;
0 Operating system;
0 Middleware;
o Application;
o Formal study of access control: started in the 19705 and continues
(see Samarati and de Capitani di Vimercati (2001); Bishop (2005);
Stallings (2023)).

Access control: who can do what
' -
0 Access control is preceded by a 3-step process:
o —: is the process of ascribing a user identifier (ID) to a
human being or to another computer or network component (Sandhu
et al. (2014));
a —: is the process of binding an ID to a specific entity
(Sandhu et al. (2014)) (in other words, authentication it is the
process of determining who you are);
o —: is the process of determining what you are allowed
to do.

Users, subjects, objects, operations, permissions
o User — people who interface with the computer system;
0 Subject — computer process acting on behalf of a user;
0 Object — resource accessible on a computer system;
o Operation — active process invoked by a subject;
o Permission (privilege, right) — authorization to perform some action
on the system.

Users, subjects, objects, operations, permissions
Remark 1
o Subjects/Objects/Operations/Permissions may vary from system to
system:
o in operating systems, objects are typically files, directories or
programms;
o in database systems, objects can be relations, views etc. ,'
o Traditionally:
o subjects are viewed as active entities ( they request access to objects);
o objects are viewed as passive entities (they contain or receive
information, such as files or folders or memory segments, and should
be protected of subjects )
0 However, subjects may be themselves objects ( with operations like
kill, suspend, resume).

User-subject distinction
Remark 2
o A user can impersonate multiple users using different accounts, for
example;
o A user may not be active at some time in the system, and when it
is, there may be several subjects executing on its behalf;
o The user-subject distinction is vital if the subject’s rights are
different from the user's rights;
o In many systems, a subject that acts on behalf ofa user has all the
rights of the user.

Principle of least privilege
Principle of least privilege (Saltzer (1974)): “Every program and every
privileged user of the system should operate using the least amount of
privilege necessary to complete the job”.
Benefits:
0 Better stability;
0 Better security;
0 Easy of deployment.
ln practice, the principle is neither definable nor possible t0 enforce!

Policies, models, and mechanisms
Development process of an Access Control System (ACS) based on:
o (Security) Policy — defines the high-level requirements that specify
how access is managed and who, under what circumstances, may
access what information;
0 (Security) Model — provides a formal representation of the access
control policy and its working. A model allows proof of properties;
o (Security) Mechanism — defines the low level (software and
hardware) functions that implement a policy (model).

Policies
Three main classes of security policies:

o Discretionary (DAC) — enforce access control on the basis of the
identity of the requester and explicit access rules that establish who
can or cannot execute which actions on which resources;

0 Mandatory (MAC) — enforce access control on the basis of
regulations mandated by a central authority;

o Role-based (RBAC)— enforce access control decisions on the
functions a user is allowed to perform within an organization (the
users cannot pass access permissions on to other users at their
discretion).

The fourth class of policies comes into force: attribute-based access
control (ABAC).

Mechanisms
Modern access control mechanisms are based on the reference monitor
concept introduced by Anderson (1972).
Reference monitor: hardware and software portion of an operating system
that is responsible for the enforcement of the security policy of the
system.

Reference Monitor
Fundamental implementation principles of a reference monitor:
o Completeness — it must be always invoked and impossible to bypass;
o Isolation — it must be tamper-proof;
o Veriﬁability — it must be shown to be properly implemented.
Additional design principles of an access control system:
o Flexibility — the system should be able to enforce the access control
policies of the host enterprise;
o Manageability — the system should be intuitive and easy to manage;
0 Scalability — with respect to the number of users and resources.

Auditing

o System auditing is a method of obtaining information on the
effectiveness of implementing specific policies or procedures for the
operation or security of the system;

o Auditing can help correct operating errors, security breaches, or
improper granting of access rights to system resources;

0 For example, many events can be audited in the Windows operating
system (Microsoft (2021)), such as account logon events, account
management, directory service access, object access, privilege use,
etc.
