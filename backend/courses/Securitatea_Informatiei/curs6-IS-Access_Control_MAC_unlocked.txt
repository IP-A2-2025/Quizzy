Mandatory access control
o MAC enforces access control based on regulations mandated by a
central authority;
o No concept of ownership in MAC;
o MAC makes distinction between users and subjects:
0 Users are trusted (must be trusted) not to disclose secret information
outside of the computer system;
o Subjects are not trusted (they may have Trojan horses embedded
into the code they execute).
0 The Bell-LaPadula model (confidentiality);
o The Biba model (integrity);
o The Chinese wall model (separation of duty).

Information flow models
Information flow (IF) models were introduced by Denning (1976).
o IF models are concerned with the flow of information from one
security class to another;
0 Object : viewed as a container of information;
0 Examples of objects: files or directories in an operating system, or
relations and tuples in a database;
o Information flow is controlled by assigning every object a security
class or security label.

Information flow models: definition
Definition 1
An information flow model is a triple (SC,%,EB), Where:

o SC is a set of elements called security classes (or access classes or
security labels);

0 —>§ SC >< SC is a binary relation called may-flow;

0 69 : SC >< SC —> SC is a commutative and associative operator
called the class combiner operator.

Meaning:

0 The semantics of a security class is varied and depends on the
purpose of use (e.g., for confidentiality, integrity, categories or
compartments of objects and subjects, etc.);

0 A e B : the information may flow from A to B;

o A Q9 B : if information from A and B are combined, the result
belongs to A 63 B.

Information flow models: Denning’s axioms
Denning's axioms:
Axiom 1: SC is finite;
Axiom 2: The may-flow relation —> is a partial order;
Axiom 3: 5C has a least element W.r.t. —>;
wilhreferenceto
Axiom 4: G9 is a least upper bound operator.
Proposition 2
Any information flow model that satisﬁes the Denning's axioms is a
lattice.
In what follows, all IF models we consider satisfy the Denning's axioms!

Information flow models: dominance
Definition 3
Let (SC,—>,69) be an information flow model and A, B € 5C. We say
that A dominates B, denoted A Z B, if B —> A.
Notation and terminology:
o A > B (A strictly dominates B) if A dominates B and A 75 B;
0 A and B are comparable if A Z B or B Z A;
0 A and B are incomparable if A and B are not comparable.

Confidentiality-based mandatory policies
_; ﬂuxul informational: de jos in sus (de la elementul oel mai mic din latice la oel mai mare)
0 Aim: control the direct and indirect flows of information by
preventing leakages to unauthorized subjects;
o Subjects and objects are assigned security levels (security classes);
o The security level of an object, also called security classification,
reflects the sensitivity of the information contained in the object;
o The security level of a subject, also called security clearance, reflects
the user's trustworthiness;
0 Requests of subjects to access objects are regulated by means of
their security classes.
Each user with a security class assigned to it can connect to the system
(as a principal) at any security class dominated by its security class.

The Bell-LaPadula model: a minimalist approach
Proposed by Bell and LaPadula (1973) to formalize the multilevel
security policy of the U.S. Department of Defense.
— of the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model:
o Key idea: augment DAC with MAC to enforce information flow
policies;
0 Two-step approach:
1. First, a discretionary access control matrix D is established;
2. Second, operations must be authorized by the mandatory access
control policy;
o The model was initially defined for a fixed set of rights R : {r, w}.

The Bell-LaPadula model: a minimalist approach
The MAC in the BLP model:
o Assign labels to subjects and objects by some labelling function A;
0 Rules (N0 Read Up — N0 Write Down):
1. Simple security (ss-) property —
sis allowed to read o only if Ms) Z Mo)
2. *-property — s is allowed to write o only if /\(s) g /\(o)
Initially, the BLP model assumed that the labels of subjects and objects,
once assigned, could not be changed (unless a security administrator
resets them). This property has been called the tranquility principle.
However, it can be relaxed without losing security (Sandhu (1993)).

***************Ending Page***************

***************Beginning Page***************
***************page number:16**************
On the *-property
Remark 4
The *-property avoids Trojan horse attacks because subjects cannot
transfer information to a security class with lower sensitivity than their
security clearance.
Through the simple security property, any subject can transmit
information (e.g., emails) to a higher (dominant) security class.
Users are not restricted by the *-property, as they can connect to the
system ( as principals) at any security class dominated by their security
clearance.
Remark 5
The *-property allows secret data be destroyed or damaged by
unclassified subjects. To prevent this the *-property is sometimes used
in the form
Strong *-property — s is allowed to write o only if /\(s) : /\(o)

The Bell-LaPadula model: remarks

0 In some approaches, write access means “read and write", with
append access provided for “write only";

o The BLP model is stated in terms of read and write operations
(which suffices to illustrate the main points). Other operations may
be added, such as create and destroy objects, constrained by the
*-property because they modify the state of the object in question;

o Mandatory controls in BLP are coupled with discretionary control: if
the access control matrix does not authorizes the operation, there is
no need to check the mandatory controls since the operation will be
rejected anyway;

0 A user can login (create a subject) with any label dominated by the
user's clearance.

Integrity-based mandatory policies
-I ﬂuxul informational: de sus in jos (de la elementul cel mai mare din latioe la oel mai mic)
0 Aim: control the flows of information and prevent subjects to
indirectly modify information they cannot write;
o Subjects and objects are assigned integrity levels (integrity classes);
o The integrity level of an object reflects both the degree of trust of
the information stored in the object and the potential damage
resulting from unauthorized modifications of the information;
o The integrity level of a subject reflects the user's trustworthiness for
inserting, modifying, or deleting information;
0 Requests of subjects to access objects are regulated by means of
their integrity classes.

The Biba model
Proposed by Biba (1977).
The MAC in the Biba model:

l. Simple integrity (si-) property —
sis allowed to read o only if w(s) g 01(0)
2. Integrity *-property — s is allowed to write o only if w(s) Z w(o)
Remark 6

Combining the BLP and Biba Models
o There is no fundamental difference between the BLP and Biba
models: both are concerned with information flow in a lattice of
security classes;
o ln the BLP model, the information flows upward;
o In the Biba model, the information flows downward;
o The direction is irrelevant: it is a matter of convention in
representing the highest security class (in our case, in both the BLP
and Biba models the highest security class on top of the lattice).

Criticisms of the model
The *-property of the Chinese wall model protects against Trojan
horse-like attacks. However, the price is unacceptable:
1. A user that reads two company datasets cannot write at all;
2. A user that is allowed to read just one company dataset can write
only to that dataset.
A typical activity of a user requires reading and writing operations. The
Chinese wall model thus limits the activity of users only to working with a
single company. Sandhu (1992) highlighted this.
This anomaly occurs because the model does not distinguish between
rules applied to users and subjects (see the concept of subject in this
model).

A lattice representation: user, principal, and subject labeling
o Each user U may have associated any security label, except for T;
o Each user U with the security label X has associated the principals
U.Y, for any Y dominated by X;
o Each principal U.Y has associated the fixed security label Y. Each
subject created by the principal inherits this label.
Example 7
If Alice has the security label Bankl, then she has associated two
principals, Alice.Pub/ic,lnfo and Alice.Bank1. So, she can read from
Pub/icslnfo and Ban/<1, and write to (Ban/<1, Oi/Cl) and (Ban/<1, Oi/CZ).
The conflict of interest is thus avoided.

MAC recent implementations: MIC
Mandatory Integrity Control in Windows operating systems:

o Starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, Microsoft
adds a Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) (Microsoft (2021));

o MIC is a form of the Biba model ensuring integrity to writes and
deletions: to write to 0r delete an object, the subject's integrity level
must be greater than or equal to the object’ integrity level;

o There are six integrity levels: Untrusted, Low (everyone), Medium
(standard and authenticated users), High (local or network services,
elevated users), System (system services), and Trusted Installer;

o Subjects’ integrity level: when a user logs on, Windows Vista assigns
an integrity SID to the user's access token;

o Objects’ integrity level: ﬁles, pipes, threads, registry keys, printers
etc., are assigned an integrity SID which is stored in the System
Access Control List (SACL).

MAC recent implementations: MAC and MIC in IBM AIX 7.2
IBM AIX 7.2. Security:
“Mandatory Access Control is enforced any time a process attempts to
open a file system object, retrieve the attributes of a file system object,
send a signal to a process, transfer data through a STREAM, or send or
receive a packet through a network interface. Access to any file system
object is only possible if both MAC and DAC criteria are met. When a
user attempts to access a file, MAC restrictions are enforced before DAC
restrictions, such as permission bits or ACLs, are checked."
“Trusted AIX uses a system of labels to enforce MIC. On a Trusted AIX
system, all named objects have integrity labels (TLs) to identify the
object's integrity level. Processes also have TLs. Process TLs indicate
which level of information integrity the process is allowed to access. The
higher the TL, the more trustworthy the object or process is."

Covert channels
Definition 8 (From NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5)
A covert channel is an unintended or unauthorized intra-system channel
that enables two cooperating entities to transfer information in a way
that violates the system's security policy but does not exceed the
entities’ access authorizations.

0 They were signaled by Lampson (1973);

o Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), also called
the Orange Book, defines two kinds of covert channels:

o Storage channels — modify storage location to communicate;
o Timing channels — use a delay between packets transmitted over a
network;

0 Covert channels require a cooperating sender and receiver, are hard
to detect and control, and can exist in any MAC system. MAC
cannot protect against them!

models

***************Ending Page***************

***************Beginning Page***************
***************page number:46**************
Concluding remarks

o MAC enforces access control on the basis of regulations mandated
by a central authority;

o MAC makes clear distinction between users and subjects;

o Lattice-based access control (LBAC), also called label-based access
control or rule-based access control or multilevel access control, is a
form of MAC;

o In LBAC, a lattice is used to define levels of security an object or
subject may have;

o Mandatory policies protect the flow of information over overt
channels (i.e., legitimate channels) but not over covert channels.
