A Game always has:

. A starting state (the game instance)

0 At least one state which determines the end of the game if

reached

, At least one goal for each player (not necessarily an end state)

. Rules for each player (not always the same)

0 At least two sources determining changes to the current state

MINIMAX considerations

o The objective of MINIMAX is to allow the opponent to make the
worst possible moves, assuming it will always choose the best
move available.

0 The depth of exploration is crucial to the MINIMAX accuracy.

o The depth of exploration is limited by the necessity to store every
explored state. For chess (average branching factor of 35), a
depth of 4 would require l,5 00,625 states. An exhaustive
exploration would require lO3O states.

o MINIMAX is predictable and assumes predictable opponents.

Nash Equilibrium

If in a game all players obey the game rules and aim to maximize
their payoffs, there is at least one strategy for each player which
guarantees maximum payoffs for each player.

That strategy is called Nash optimum or equilibrium.

No player has a reason to change an equilibrium as long as anybody
follows one.

A dominant and Paretto optimal strategy is always an equilibrium.
However, for most games no dominant strategies exist.

Mixed strategies

Strategies which are not pure are called mixed.

For most games, pure strategies are not equilibria.

Computing equilibria as a mixed strategy
W Left Right

The equilibria (EQS and EQK) rnust provide equal payoffs for all possible opponent
decisions.
EQS(Left) payoff is - l *EQK(Left)+l *EQK(Right)
EQS(Right) payoff is l*EQK(Left)-l >‘<EQK(Right)
Equal payoff means that - l *EQK(Left)+l *EQK(Right):l >"EQK(Left)-l *EQK(Right)
So EQK(Left):EQK(Right):O.5 since EQK(Left)+EQK(Left):l. Equilibria is reached
when both choices are as probable.

Overall considerations about strategies

0 Strategies should have to have a way of estimating the missing information (eg. other
player’s decisions)

o Strategies have to be unpredictable: many use either random steps or select randomly
between two or more strategies

0 You can prove that some strategies are better than others

o If a there is a strategy better than all others then it’s not a game, it’s a puzzle

0 An useful benchmark strategy is the equilibria which exists and can be determined for
all games
