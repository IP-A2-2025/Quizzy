Non Functlonal Software Testing

> Verifies that the software functions properly even
when it receives invalid or unexpected inputs

> Methods:

o Performance testing or Load Testing checks to see if the
software can handle large quantities of data or users
(software scalability).

O Usability testing checks if the user interface is easy to use
and understand.

O Security testing is essential for software which processes
confidential data and to prevent system intrusion by
hackers.

o Internationalization and localization is needed to test these
aspects of software, for which a pseudo localization method

I can be used.

Software Performance Testl ng
> Types

O load testing — can be the expected concurrent number
of users on the application (database is monitored)

O stress testing — is used to break the application (2 x
users, extreme load) (application's robustness)

O endurance testing — if the application can sustain the
continuous expected load (for memory leaks)

O spike testing — spiking the number of users and
understanding the behavior of the application whether
it will go down or will it be able to handle dramatic
changesinload

Usability testing
> A technique used to evaluate a product by testing it
Ol'l USEl'S
> Usability testing focuses on measuring a human-
made product's capacity to meet |ts Intended
purpose.
> Examples of products that commonly benefit from
usabl |ty testin? are web sites or web ap_pl|cat|ons,
computer |nter aces, documents, or deVIces
> Goals
O Performance — How much time, steps?
o Accuracy — How many mistakes did people make?
<> Recall — How much does the person remember afterwards
or after periods of non-use?
o Emotional response — How does thecperson feel about the
tasks completed? ls the person confi ent, stressed? Would
er recommend this system to a friend?

Secu r|ty testl ng

> The Process to determine that an Information
System protects data and maintains functionality as
intended.

> The six basic security concepts that need to be
covered by security testing are:

O Confidentiality,

O Integrity — information which it receives has not been
altered in transit or by other than the originator of the
information

O Authentication — validity of a transmission, message, or
or|g|nator,

O Authorization — determining that a requester is allowed to
receive a service or perform an operation,

<> Availability — Assuring information and communications
services will be ready for use when expected,

O Non-repudiation — prevent the later denial that an action

Internationalization and

locaHzann

> Means of adapting computer software to
different languages and regional differences

> Internationalization is the process of designing
a software application so that it can be adapted
to various languages and regions without
engineering changes.

> Localization is the process of adapting software
for a specific region or language by adding
locale-specific components and translating text.

Measuring software testlng

> Usually, quality is constrained to such topics as
correctness, completeness, security

> Can also include capability, reliability, efficiency,
portability, maintainability, compatibility, and
usability

> There are a number of common software
measures, often called "metrics", which are used
to measure the state of the software or the
adequacy of the testing.

Degradation of code

> Initial code is clean and well structured

> As it is developed, it degrades because of
incremental changes

> Eventually, it becomes difficult to maintain,
extend or debug

Degradation of code

> Rigidity — the tendency for software to be difficult
to change, even in simple ways

> Fragility — the tendency of the software to break
in many places every time it is changed

> lmmobility — the inability to reuse software from
other projects or from parts of the same project

> Viscosity — it is easy to do the wrong thing, but
hard to do the right thing

Refactorl ng

> .. the process of changing a software
system in such a way that it does not a/ter the
external behavior of the code yet improves its
interna/ structure." — Martin Fowler in
Refactoring improving The Design 0f Existing
Code

> Making code cleaner, simpler ancl more
elegant

> The refactored program must be functionally
equivalent to the initial program

Refactorlng

> Refactoring doesn’t prevent changing
functionality, itjust says that it’s a different
activity from rearranging code

> It is easier to improve code quality if you
don’t also change its functionality

> Refactoring is not rewriting
o refactoring does not change functionality
O rewriting does change it

How to Refactor
> Prepare a set of automatic tests for the
program to be refactored
> Change the code in small iterations
O Test for each iteration to ensure semantic
equivalence
o If any test fails, undo the change and try a different
one
> After numerous iterations the cumulated
changes will be large

Refactorlng Techn lques
> lncrease abstraction
O Encapsulate Field — force code to access the field
with getter and setter methods
O Generalize Type — create more general types to
allow for more code sharing
O Replace type — checking code with State/Strategy
O Replace conditional with polymorphism
> Split code into more logical pieces
O Extract Method, to turn part of a larger method into
a new method.
O Extract Class moves part of the code from an
existing class into a new class.

Refactorlng Techniques
> Improving names and location of code
O Move Method or Move Field — move to a more
appropriate Class or source file
O Rename Method or Rename Field — changing the
name into a more representative new one
O Pull Up — in OOP, move to a superclass
O Push Down — in OOP, move to a subclass

The Single Responsibility Principle
> Should these responsibilities be separated?

O If the implementations for the communication and
connection management change independently,
separately

O If the implementations only change together, do not
separate

> Corollary: An axis of change is only an axis of
change if the changes actually occur.

The Open Closed Princlple

> You should be able to extend a class’
behavior Without modifying it.

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions,
etc.) should be open for extension, but closed
for modification.

> The primary mechanisms behind the Open-
Closed principle are abstraction and
polymorphism.

The Liskov Substitution Principle

> Derived classes must be substitutable for
their base classes.

> Makes applications more maintainable,
reusable ancl robust

> lf there is a function which does not conform
to the LSP, then that function uses a reference
to a base class, but must know about all the
derivatives of that base class.

> Such a function violates the Open-Closed
principle

The Dependency Inversion
Principle
> What is it that makes a design bad?

o most software eventually degrades to the point
where someone will declare the design to be
unsound

O Because of the lack of a good working definition
of “bad” design.

***************Ending Page***************


***************Beginning Page***************
***************page number:31**************
The Dependency Inversion
Principle
> The Definition of a “Bad Design"
o It is hard to change because every change affects
too many other parts of the system. (Rigidity)
O When you make a change, unexpected parts of
the system break. (Fragility)
O It is hard to reuse in another application because
it cannot be separated from the current
application. (lmmobility)

The Dependency Inversion

Principle

> A. High level modules should not depend
upon low level modules. Both should depend

details. Details should depend upon
abstractions.

Object-Orlented Desrgn

> The most common types of programming are
Structured Programming and Object Oriented
Programming

> It has become difficult to write a program that
does not have the external appearance of both
structured programming and object oriented
programming
O Do not have goto
O class based and do not support functions or variables

that are not within a class

> Programs may look structured and object

oriented, but looks can be deceiving

complexity they require some kind of high
level organization.

packages, and what design principles govern
their use?

look at the source code. The author is
responsible for maintenance
O lam the customer
O When the libraries that | am reusing are changed by
the author, | need to be notified
o | may decide to use the old version of the library for
a time
o lwill need the author to make regular releases of

The Reuse/Release Equivalence

Principle

> The granule of reuse is the granule of release.
Only components that are released through a
tracking system can be effectively reused.
This granule is the package.

***************Ending Page***************


***************Beginning Page***************
***************page number:39**************
The Common Reuse Principle

> The classes in a package are reused together.
If you reuse one 0f the classes in a package,
you reuse them a//.

> Which classes should be placed into a
package?
O Classes that tend to be reused together belong in

the same package.

> Packages to have physical representations

that need to be distributed.

The Common Reuse Principle

> l want to make sure that when | depend upon
a package, l depend upon every class in that
package or | am wasting effort.

***************Ending Page***************


***************Beginning Page***************
***************page number:41**************
The Common Closure Principle

> The classes in a package should be closed
together against the same kinds of changes.
A change that affects a package affects all the
classes in that package.

> If two classes are so tightly bound, either
physically or conceptually, such that they
almost always change together; then they
belong in the same package.

The Acyclic Dependencies Principle
> The morning after syndrome: you make stuff
work and then gone home; next morning it

longer works? Why? Because somebody
stayed later than you!

> Many developers are modifying the same
source files.

> Partition the development environment into
releasable packages

> You must manage the dependency structure
0f the packages

***************Ending Page***************

Stability

> Not easily moved

> A measure of the difficulty in changing a

The Stable Dependencies Principle

> The dependencies between packages in a
design should be in the direction of the
stability of the packages. A package should
only depend upon packages that are more

be unstable are not depended upon by
modules that are more stable

2. Go hack and study the Structure, Participants,
and Collaborations sections

3. Look at the Sample Code section to see a
concrete example

4. Choose names for pattern participants that are
meaningful in the application context

5. Deﬁne the classes
