> Intent — Given a language, define a
representation for its grammar along with an
interpreter

> Motivation — If a particular kind of problem
occurs often enough, then it might be
worthwhile to express instances of the problem
as sentences in a simple language. Then you can
build an interpreter that solves the problem by
interpreting these sentences.

v The “musical notes" is an “Interpreted Language". The
musicians read the notes, interpret them according to

“Sa, Re, Ga, Ma..." or “Do, Re, Mi... " etc. and play the

instruments, what we get in output is musical sound

waves. Think of a program which can take the Sa, Re,

Ga, Ma etc. and produce the sounds for the

frequencies.

> For Sa, the frequency is 256 Hz, similarly, for Re, it is
288Hz and for Ga, it is 320 Hz etc...

Mediator

> lntent — Define an object that encapsulates how

the distribution of behavior among objects.

> According to (Gamma et al), the Mediator
pattern should be used when:
= a set of objects communicate in wellidefined but
complex ways. The resulting interdependencies are
unstructured and difficult to understand.
