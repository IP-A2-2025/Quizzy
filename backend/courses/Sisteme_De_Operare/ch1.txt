' Hardware — provides basic computing resources
> CPU, memory, l/O devices
' Operating system
> Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various
applications and users
. Application programs — define the ways in which the system
resources are used to solve the computing problems of the
users

systems, video games

happy
' Operating system is a resource allocator and control program making
efficient use of HW and managing execution of user programs
I Users of dedicate systems such as workstations have dedicated resources but
frequently use shared resources from servers
I Mobile devices like smartphones and tables are resource poor, optimized for
usability and battery life
. Mobile user interfaces such as touch screens, voice recognition
I Some computers have little or no user interface, such as embedded computers in
devices and automobiles

"IQ
“V Storage Def|n|t|ons and Notatlon ReVIew
The basic unit of computer storage is the bit . A bit can contain one of two
values, 0 and 1. All other storage in a computer is based on collections of bits.
Given enough bits, it is amazing how many things a computer can represent:
numbers, letters, images, movies, sounds, documents, and programs, to name
a few. A byte is 8 bits, and on most computers it is the smallest convenient
chunk of storage. For example, most computers don't have an instruction to
move a bit but do have one to move a byte. A less common term is word,
which is a given computer architecture’s native unit of data. A word is made
up of one or more bytes. For example, a computer that has 64-bit registers and
64-bit memory addressing typically has 64-bit (8-byte) words. A computer
executes many operations in its native word size rather than a byte at a time.
Computer storage, along with most computer throughput, is generally
measured and manipulated in bytes and collections of bytes. A kilobyte , or
KB , is 1,024 bytes; a megabyte , or MB , is 1,0242 bytes; a gigabyte , or GB , is
1,0243 bytes; a terabyte , or TB , is 1,0244 bytes; and a petabyte , or PB , is 1,0245
bytes. Computer manufacturers often round off these numbers and say that
a megabyte is 1 million bytes and a gigabyte is 1 billion bytes. Networking
measurements are an exception to this general rule; they are given in bits
(because networks move data a bit at a time).

championed by different groups of people

I Examples include GNU/Linux and BSD UNIX (including core of Mac
OS X), and many more
I Can use VMM like VMware Player (Free on Windows), Virtualbox
(open source and free on many platforms - http://www.virtualbox.com)
' Use to run guest operating systems for exploration

M r91"? The Study of Operatl ng Systems
There has never been a more interesting time to study operating systems, and it has never been
easier. The open-source movement has overtaken operating systems, causing many of them to be
made available in both source and binary (executable) format. The list of operating
systems available in both formats includes Linux, BSD UNIX, Solaris, and part of macOS.

The availability of source code allows us to study operating systems from the inside out.

Questions that we could once answer only by looking at documentation or the behavior of an

operating system we can now answer by examining the code itself.

Operating systems that are no longer commercially viable have been open-sourced as well, enabling

us to study how systems operated in a time of fewer CPU, memory, and storage resources.

An extensive but incomplete list of open-source operating-system projects is available

from https://curlie.org/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Open_Source/

In addition, the rise of virtualization as a mainstream (and frequently free) computer function

makes it possible to run many operating systems on top of one core system. For example, VMware

(http://www.vmware.com) providesa free “player” for Windows on which hundreds of free

“virtual appliances” can run. Virtualbox (http://www.virtualbox.com) provides a free, open-source

virtual machine manager on many operating systems. Using such tools, students can try out

hundreds of operating systems without dedicated hardware.

The advent of open-source operating systems has also made it easier to make the move from

student to operating-system developer. With some knowledge, some effort, and an Internet

connection, a student can even create a new operating-system distribution. Just a few years ago,

it was difficult or impossible to get access to source code. Now, such access is limited only by

how much interest, time, and disk space a student has.
