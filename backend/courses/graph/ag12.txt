A graph is planar if and only if it has an embedding on a sphere. ‘

y the diametral point of a: in S. Consider g0 : 1r —> S \ {y} given by
<p(M) : the point different from y in which the line My intersects the

of G on 5.

Conversely, if G has an embedding on a sphere 5: take y a point in S“,
consider x, the diametral point of y on S, construct a tangent plane 1r

planar representation of G. U J
Let G be a plane graph. If we delete the points of G (its vertices and
edges) from the plane, this is decomposed into a ﬁnite union of maximal
connected regionsa of the plane, which are called the faces of G.
Exactly one of these faces is unbounded and it is called the exterior
(outer) face.
Each face is characterised by the set of edges forming its boundary.
Every cycle of G divides the plane in exactly two connected regions,
hence every edge of a cycle belongs to exactly two boundaries (of two
faces).
A planar graph may have different planar representations.
WPOlHtS of a connected region can be joined by a
simple curve contained in that region.

Proof cont’d. If f : 1, then G has no cycle and, since it is connected,
it is a tree. It follows that m : n — 1 and the theorem holds.

In the inductive step, suppose that the theorem holds for any connected
plane graph with strictly less than f(> 2) faces. Let e be an edge
belonging to a cycle of G (there is such cycle, since f 2 2). Then
e belongs to the boundary of exactly two faces of G. It follows that
G1 : G — e is a connected plane graph having n vertices, m — 1 edges
and f— 1 faces. The theorem holds for G1, therefore f— 1 : m—1—n+2,

Proof. Let G’ be a planar representation of G. If G’ has only one face,
then G is a tree, m : n — 1, and for n 2 3 the stated inequality holds.
If G’ has at least two faces, then each face F of G’ has in its boundary
the edges of a cycle GF (and maybe some other edges), and each such

If 11111112 ¢ E, then on the simple curve joining the points corresponding

corresponding to 'u; if wl 1112 6 E we consider a new point corresponding

In its planar representation, delete the point corresponding to 'u and the

two curves corresponding to 'u'wl and 111112 are replaced by their union; if

wl'wz E E, then the simple curve corresponding to it is deleted. D

We denote by h*(G) the graph obtained from G by applying repeatedly

the h transformation until a graph without vertices of degree two is

obtained.

It follows that G is planar if and only if h*(G) is planar.

Two graphs G1 and G2 are homeomorphic if h*(G1) g h*(G2).

(Kuratowski, 1930) A graph is planar if and only if it has no subgraphs

homeomorphic to K5 or K33.

Algorithmic proof. We will outline an O(n log n) drawing.

W. l. 0. g., we will assume that G is maximal planar: Ve E E(G),

G + e is not planar (we add edges to G in order to make it maximal

planar and when these additional edges (segments) are drawn they are

invisible). Note that any face of a maximal planar graph is a triangle

and has 3n — 6 edges, where n is its number of vertices.

Let G be a planar graph and G’ be a planar representation of G. If C"

is a cycle of G’ passing through the edge u'u E E(G’), then there exists

w 6 V(C’) such that w 5i u, 'u and there is no interior chord of C’ with

one extremity in w.

not the extremity of an interior chord of C,Q_1.

From the construction, 'uk_1 is not adjacent with external chords of Cléil

(Tarjan 8c Lipton, 1979) Let G be a planar graph With n vertices. There

o S separates A from B in G: G — S has no edges from A to B,

° IAI é (2/3)n, IBI é (2/3)n,

This partition can be found in (9(n) time. ‘
Proof idea. Let G be a connected plane graph. Perform a bfs traversal
from some vertex s, labeling each vertex 'u by its level in the bfs tree
obtained. Let L(t), the set of all vertices on the level t, for 0 é t é 1+ 1.
The last level L(l + 1) is empty - for technical reasons (the last level is
in fact l). ‘

integer satisfying t > t1 and |L(t2)| g J5 (note that |L(l + 1)| : O).
Any level between to and t2 has more than \/H vertices, therefore the
number of these levels is less than \/H (otherwise, the number of vertices

lows: delete all the vertices of G which are not from D, excepting s
which is joined with all vertices of the level t0 + 1. The graph obtained
is denoted by D and is planar and connected. It has a spanning tree of
diameter at most 2\/H (any vertex is reached from s by a path of length
at most JR, as we prooved in the Lemma above). This tree is dfs tra-
versed in order to obtain the desired separator. Details (very nice) are

Let us consider the problem of deciding if a given planar graph has a

For a graph G with a small number of vertices (for a constant number
